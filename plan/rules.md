- all comments in the code should be in English

- i prefer fewer lines of codes, as soon as they are readable and understandable. for example, I prefer  
{'id': 'walkforward', 'name': 'WalkForward', 'type': 'walk_forward', 'train_days': 252, 'test_days': 63}
don't prefer:
    {
        'id': 'walkforward',
        'name': 'WalkForward',
        'type': 'walk_forward',
        'train_days': 252,
        'test_days': 63
    }

- don't add unnecessary print in the codes, and try to combine them in fewer line of codes for print results or prompts

- keep MVP concepts and occam razor principle - don't add codes or new features unless they are necessary or will significantly improve the project

- use functional programming
